# Paradigm Capital Case Study

This project showcases a dashboard with various pages, including a **home page**, **client dashboard**, **trade dashboard**, and **each client's individual trade details**. Below are the instructions for setting up the project locally, and instructions to view the deployed app.

## Pages Overview
